[title=STAIRS_GUARD]
No can do, my green friend.
Floor 2 is members-only.

[title=WAREHOUSE_GUARD]
Woah! Stop right there, little man. This is a resctricted area. 
Who let you in here anyway?

[title=G_RAFF_CARE]
WHOA!!! What happened to your leg, bro?!?!
What? Your girl Betty is missing???
Damn, well... i wish i knew something about anything.
Macabras only talk business to me.
I just move their product. That's it.
They trust me just because i'm too tall to sniff around their madhouse.
I can't help you...
... but i know someone who can.
...pssst FOLLOW ME.

[title=GALLERY]
Stay TRUE
Make him proud!
MAC!
ABRA!

[title=SIDE_GUARD]
Hey stranger! This is private property. 
Take your business elsewhere.
I said BEAT IT!!!
Don't make me say it again!
---
What was that?
It better not be that green insect.

A few hours later...
BETTY!!!
Where are you!???

[title=TRESPASS]
It's ok to be confused with all that is happening.
That van that hit you on the road were the MacaBros. 
They're the worst scum among the MACABRA clan.
The clan... well, it all started a long time ago...
... at ROOM 0...
... with one particular guest...
Nobody ever guessed he...

[title=LFG]
G-RAFF!!!
Where's that damn giraffe when you need it!???

[title=SCARED-G]
Oh no!
That guard's looking for me
... again.
You go! 
Find Ol-D... tell him i sent you.
I'll come back for you!


[title=OLDIE]
God damn, G.
Not again... 
That kid needs to stop chasing rainbows.
Trust me! It's different with this one, D.
Man... that leg looks pretty bad...
Oh, what the hell. He'll end up as one of them either way...
... one more won't make any difference.
Don't worry, I already told em' he's with workin' with me.
I'll get him in there, so he can find out what happened to his girl.
I believe we both know the answer to that question, G.
Hang in there, buddy!
[title=PoolTable]
So you wanna be one of us, huh?
You’ll have to beat Macabro on the dance floor. 
Hahahaaa… this guy? 
Look at him, he doesn’t stand a chance.

[title=DanceHero-Intro]
Well… well… well…
Look at what we got here!
FRESH MEAT!
Show me what you got, little man.
If you got any…
DANCE
OFF!
[title=DanceHero-Rock]
DAMN IT!
Welcome to the clan, bro.
You are one of us now.

[title=DanceHero-Suck]
HAHAHA! I RULE!
YOU SUCK!
Now... get the hell outta here!

[title=Baptism]
HELLO, ElvisVonTrapp.
Elvis Von Trapp
That was the last time you’ll answer to that name…
HATRED
The only feeling left within your soul…
You are a MACABRA. You’re part of the family now.
You go out there, and make us proud.
... because Mother is always watching...

[title=STAIRS_GUARD-Free]
We have a new member joining the gang!
Ohhh! That's my song!
YAY! So happy!!!

[title=NIGHTMARE]
"HI, Elvis…"
"This… is… Betty."
"I just want you to know that… us…"
"WE ARE OVER"
"Just leave me alone..."
"...go back home, you STULLE"

[title=GRAFF-Extension]
Yo, Elvis! Nice to see you again, bro!
I see you're a Macabra now.
I guess that means Betty didn't show up yet.
Well, now that you're one of them you can access the console back there.
You can open that big generator thing...
but... you'll need to enter the combination.
I heard Macabras talking about that inside the house.
You should go find out and...
HURRY!!!
That mask you are wearing corrupts your mind over time.

[title=PoolGuard]
HEY! Where do you think you're going?!?!
I see you're a one of us now.
You better stay TRUE or stay DEAD.

[title=PoolGuard]
Hey! Nothing to see there...
Just drink Macabras and... DANCE!

[title=BAT]
Whooooa...
... just look at this thing!
I think we'll become close friends with this baby.
I'll show Macabras who they messed with.
I'll get every one of them...
for taking Betty!
Prepare yourselves Macabras!!!
Because HERE I COME!
HA!
HAHA!
HAHAHA!!!
HAAAA HAAAA HAAAA!!!!

[title=GRAFF-POST]
Bro! Thank god you're alive...
... and you have a bat?!? Wow, that mask is kickin' in already.
Go put that combination in the generator beneath Black Lotus's sign.
But be careful...
Macabras are already looking for you.
I tried to cover you up but you got too much heat.
Just... don't get captured alive...
---
C'mon, Elvis! My life's at stake too!
We can do this... 
for BETTY!!!
Now go and input that combination on the generator.
Be careful, bro!
---
He's green, he just wears boots and a leopard thong.
Father wants him... dead or alive...
Macabras don't miss! Remember that!
MAKE HIM PROUD!

Hey, what's up, bro? 
I'm G-RAFF but you can call me G... *BURP*
Sorry, i think that was too much beer... 
... i can't get enough these days... *sad*
But then i just come see the brightness of the moon and honor it with my DANCE!
How did you manage to get in here anyway?

Hey look! What do think of this one?
That little one?
YEAAAH! You can do it, green fella!
I'd leave now if i were you...


[title=MACABRAS-POST-BAPTISM]
Hello Macabra, welcome to the family...
Hey! You're the newcomer, right? 
Go check out the laptop behind you...
You beat Macabro on the floor? So i guess that makes you one of us now... 
Do you know what happens to the ones that don't fit? 
Nevermind...


[title=Baptism-2]
Don't look back for past memories...
... that will only get you hurt...
... embrace your new self...
MACABRA until the end!!!
